# project-2-reverse-engineering
Collaboration Project to reverse engineer and redesign a website.

Craigslist is one site which has not changed since it was developed. My partner and I decided to re-design the site. The link to our site is posted below. 

## User Story:

On the landing page:

As a user, I want to log in to my account using Gmail account to create, post, and delete any listings.


Main page:

Aa a User I want to click on a Job listing/items for sale, which will then direct me to a page where I am able to see all my posts. 
As a User I want to have the option to leave a page. I am able to do so by clicking to the site logo on the navbar. This will direct me back to landing page. 


Job/Item posting pages:

As a User once logged in to my account, I want to have the option to post, update, delete or edit my previous jobs or items for sale posts.
